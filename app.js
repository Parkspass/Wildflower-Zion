The two flower types are disc flowers and ray flowers. Disc flowers form the flower head’s ‘eye’, while ray flowers look like petals on a simpler flower. Beneath the flower head is a collection of modified leaves or bracts, forming the involucre. Each individual bract is technically known as a phyllary. ( FIL-uh-ree). Three kinds of composite flowers: Heads composed of only ray flowers, such as dandelion, endive, chicory and wild lettuce. Heads composed of only disc flowers as in thistles, or burdock, or heads composed of both disc and ray flowers, with disc flowers tightly packed together in the head’s ‘eye, while enlarged ray flowers function as petals radiating outward from the eye, such as sunflowers, asters, Black eyes Susan, chrysanthemums, dahlias and the red zinnia.

Zion has induced prescribed fires to keep this cycle in play. It is common to see charred bark on living trees.\nPonderosa pine was extensively logged in the park, leaving only the most remote stands untouched. There are still some of these left, with trunks to 6.5 feet (2 m) wide. The park is still recovering from the lumber days. Also called \"yellow pine\".",
