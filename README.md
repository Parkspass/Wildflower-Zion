# Wildflower Zion App

This was a fun project! It allows people to search for and identify certain wildflowers located within Zion National Park. When they are using it, they have a few options for search. They can do it using our built in flower navigation search, or they can search by scientific or common name. This app is used to make it easier for all park visitors.
